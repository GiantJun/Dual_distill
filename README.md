# Continual Learning of New Diseases with Dual Distillation and Ensemble Strategy. MICCAI2020

This is a temporary codebase of "Continual Learning of New Diseases with Dual Distillation and Ensemble Strategy", which is still dirty.

This code will be cleaned up and merged to https://github.com/GiantJun/CL_Pytorch later.

If you want to reproduce the results reported in the paper, you can run the following code in the terminal.
```
nohup python main.py > main.log 2>&1 &
